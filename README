dirclean - this is dead simple for now. Just point it at a directory with lots
of random files you feel you should do something about. First created it for
Downloads directory. Sure I could drop it to tmpfs, but it's fun to look there
after some time and sometimes there's something useful I'm too lazy to put in
proper directory in the first place.
It's also good for directory with music. There is so much stuff and I listen
to just a few albums. That's crazy, isn't it? For this purpose I created
--group switch so that I work with whole directories and not separate files.
I want to add shuffling and then MPD can go away. ;-) 

So when you run it and some files are found, they are prompted. If it's one
file (no --group option) and it is movie, mp3, pdf it's gonna be opened
before prompting. Yes, it's very dumb piece of code, but you probably can
program so just take a look at prompt.c, there is everything, you can do it,
I know it.
Later you see $file = ... and the shell is called. You can use $file variable
to make things easier. When you are done, just close it and the next is picked.
When you are too tired yet and want to stop before finishing, just kill dirclean
and close shell...

The code... Quoting one of my maths teachers, this is obvious, but the code
really is... Or quoting one of my physics teaches, why haven't you picked
history of dance instead of computer science? :-D You probably don't want
to read all so there are some usefull comments in header files. If you are
lucky, they are up-to-date.

Before you look at the code I wish you low WTF/h rate. :-) Don't take it too
seriously, the life would be too boring if the code wasn't a little bit crazy.
Like functional code in C (but not too functional - that's why C).
